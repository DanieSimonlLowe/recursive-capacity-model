# Recursive Capacity Estimation Project
## Overview

This project is a personal research and learning project focused on developing and testing methods for battery capacity estimation using recursive algorithms and circuit-model-based approaches.

The key focus is on:
* Exploring fast algorithms for capacity/state estimation.
* Avoiding deep learning and instead using model-based and statistical methods.
* Thoroughly testing subcomponents and comparing multiple approaches.
* Working with equivalent circuit models (ECMs) and interpolation techniques.

Disclaimer: This project is for educational and experimental purposes only. It is not intended for commercial use.
